## Instructions ##
1. How much time did you end up spending on this coding test?
   * It took 3 days each to plan, code and testing.

2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution and any other specific choices you made.
   * As I prefer to do full stack development, I tried to stick to the folder structure that we learned during the course. Where client folder holds frontend related html files and server folder holds server related code example: REST endpoint.    

3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.
   * If time permits, I would have tried to do the frontend in React with added CSS to make the app look better. 
   * I also observed that, my code doesn't support large files (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), I would have tried to fix if time permits.

4. What did you think of this recruitment test?
   * It was interesting as well challenging, and I feel it is a good oppurtunity and experience to learn on code improvisation based on the given test files.
